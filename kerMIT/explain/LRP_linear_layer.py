    LRP for a linear layer with input dim D and output dim M.

    - hin:            forward pass input, of shape (D,)

    - hout:           forward pass output, of shape (M,) (unequal to np.dot(w.T,hin)+b if more than one incoming layer!)
    - Rout:           relevance at layer output, of shape (M,)
    - bias_nb_units:  total number of connected lower-layer units (onto which the bias/stabilizer contribution is redistributed for sanity check)
    - eps:            stabilizer (small positive number)
    - bias_factor:    set to 1.0 to check global relevance conservation, otherwise use 0.0 to ignore bias/stabilizer redistribution (recommended)
